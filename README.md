# `snippet-translator-plugin` for webpack

This plugin is intended to produce translated bundles for **webpack** projects. It just hooks into your existing translation function and produces one bundle for each language. This is similar to how Twitter's translations work. Simply include this plugin in your ``webpack.config``, and your project will generate a whole lot more bundles.

## Install

`npm install snippet-translator-plugin [--save-dev]`
